#Cocoa Icon Theme
Icons based on OS X Yosemite/El Capitan for Ubuntu with Unity
Some icons may directly reflect the icons from OSX. This is intentional, though breaking laws is NOT intentional. If any are, or if we are asked; the icons in question will be pulled from the repository and the situation will not be repeated.

#Blueprints
* base for rounded and square icon [in progress]
* scripts to carry the theme to other distributions [postponed]
